A very slick (13KB of source, 17KB of 64 bit static binary) port scanner.

Usage
-----

$ ./portscan5

Usage: ./portscan5 hostname|ip [PARAMS]

I.e. to obtain help:
   ./portscan5 hostname|ip -h

$ ./portscan5 ip -h

Usage: ./portscan5 hostname|ip [PARAMS]

PARAMS:

-pN:M Define the port range to do the scan. N is first port and
      M is the last, always in ascendant order. Even a single port
      must be specified as a range.
-fN   (Syn) flood mode enabled. When the port scan is finished,
      this option allows you to do a syn flood to one of the found
      open ports (if there is any). N defines flood severity level,
      and goes from 0 to 9.
-gN   Defines the interval time between each port check. The default
      (250000) is the recommended for scanning Internet hosts. For
      local network hosts a lower value can be used (in instance, 
      100000). Stablishing low values can lead to false positives.
-h    Shows this brief help.
